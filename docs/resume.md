## WORK EXPERIENCE
### **AI Engineer, {Tata Consultancy Services}** [Aug 2024–Present]

#### {PoC to Production Deployment}

- **Led the transition of 3 AI/Data Engineering projects** from PoC to production for a major U.S. pharmaceutical client, including a **data optimisation pipeline that boosted processing speed by 60%.** Enabled 200+ researchers to access real-time analytics with zero downtime.

#### {AI Systems for Data Insights and Workflow Optimization}

- Engineered an AI system for **large pharma & clinical datasets** that generates **real-time code to produce graphs** and answer statistical queries using **LLM-optimised schemas** that **cut analysis time by 90%**. Integrated into the client’s SageMaker setup as FastAPI endpoints.

- Built a conversational **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **LangChain** and LLMs over the client’s documentation and codebase, streamlining **information retrieval** for everyone involved.

- Assisted in the development of an **end-to-end transcription system** that uses **Azure OpenAI Whisper**, **FFmpeg**, and **GPT-4o** with **95%+ accuracy** for clinical audio and automated the conversion of speech to structured documents with real-time summarisation and reference extraction.

- **Developed a reusable and scalable Python package** to seamlessly **integrate AI capabilities**, including multimodal support and diverse LLMs, enabling rapid adoption of advanced AI features across teams.

#### {Automating Workbook Generation for Clinical Trials}

- Designed algorithmic solutions using **openpyxl** to automate the creation of complex, interconnected workbooks, **improving data engineering efficiency and cutting manual effort by 95% (from ~5 minutes to under 15 seconds per workbook) with 100% accuracy**.

#### {R-to-Python Migration & API Development}

- Assisted in the partial **migration** of an R codebase to Python to **improve maintainability, performance, and team accessibility**. Developed FastAPI endpoints to **expose core functionalities as scalable web services**.
