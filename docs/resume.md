## WORK EXPERIENCE
### **AI Engineer** ;Aug 2024–Present;
{Tata Consultancy Services} - Noida, Uttar Pradesh
#### Data Engineering Solutions 

- **Led the transition of 3 AI/Data Engineering projects** from PoC to production for a major U.S. pharmaceutical client, including a **data optimisation pipeline that boosted processing speed by 60%.** Enabled 200+ researchers to access real-time analytics with zero downtime.

#### Automating Workbook Generation for Clinical Trials

- Designed algorithmic solutions using **openpyxl** to automate the creation of complex, interconnected workbooks, **improving data engineering efficiency and cutting manual effort by 95% (from ~5 minutes to under 15 seconds per workbook) with 100% accuracy**.

#### AI Systems for Data Insights and Workflow Optimization

- Engineered an AI system for large pharma & clinical datasets that generates **real-time code to produce graphs** and answer statistical queries using **LLM-optimised schemas** that **cut analysis time by 90%**. Integrated into the client’s SageMaker setup as **FastAPI** endpoints.

- Built a conversational **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **LangChain** and LLMs over the client’s documentation and codebase, streamlining information retrieval for everyone involved.

- Assisted in the development of an **end-to-end transcription system** that uses **Azure OpenAI Whisper**, **FFmpeg**, and **GPT-4o** with **95%+ accuracy** for clinical audio and automated the conversion of speech to structured documents with real-time summarisation and reference extraction.

- Developed a **reusable and scalable Python package** to seamlessly **integrate AI capabilities**, including multimodal support and diverse LLMs, enabling rapid adoption of advanced AI features across teams.


#### R-to-Python Migration & API Development

- Assisted in the partial migration of an R codebase to Python to improve maintainability, performance, and team accessibility. Developed FastAPI endpoints to **expose core functionalities as scalable web services**.
